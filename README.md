# Bank Transfer Management System with NestJS (COMPLETED)!

This project implements a Bank Transfer Management System using NestJS, providing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing bank transfers. It serves as a completed solution for the NestJS DTO Challenge Assignment.

### Key Features

-   **Robust CRUD API:**  Create, read, update, and delete bank transfers.
-   **Type Safety:**  Utilizes types and DTOs to ensure data integrity and validation.
-   **Error Handling:**  Implements error handling for various scenarios like transfer not found or validation errors.
-   **Unit Tests:**  Includes unit tests for service methods and API endpoints.
-   **Documentation:**  Provides documentation outlining the implementation approach and additional notes.

### Implemented Components

-   **Transfer Entity:**  Represents the core data structure for a bank transfer.
-   **Transfer DTOs:**  Defines  `TransferInput`  for receiving transfer data and  `TransferOutput`  for returning transfer details.
-   **Transfer Service:**  Handles CRUD operations on bank transfers and interacts with the data layer.
-   **Transfer Controller:**  Exposes API endpoints for managing bank transfers.

### Technologies Used

-   NestJS: JavaScript framework for building scalable Node.js applications.
-   TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for static typing and improved code maintainability.

### Getting Started (Assuming project is already set up)

1.  **Review the Codebase:**  Explore the existing code structure, including  `TransferController`,  `TransferService`, and  `TransferModule`.
2.  **Understand Types and DTOs:**  Examine the defined types (`Sender`,  `Receiver`,  `Amount`) and DTOs (`TransferInput`,  `TransferOutput`).
3.  **Explore Service Logic:**  Review the implemented logic within  `TransferService`  for CRUD operations.
4.  **Run Unit Tests:**  Execute unit tests to verify the functionality of service methods and API endpoints.
5.  **Start the Application:**  Follow the instructions provided in the project setup to launch the NestJS application.

### Additional Notes

-   Refer to the code comments and documentation for further details on the implementation.
-   This project adheres to NestJS best practices and conventions.

### Conclusion

This completed Bank Transfer Management System demonstrates the effective use of NestJS, types, DTOs, and error handling for building a robust and well-structured API. Feel free to explore the codebase and adapt it to your specific requirements.
